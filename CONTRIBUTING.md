## 🧹 Code Style & Quality

- **Linting:** Run `npm run lint` before committing. Fix all errors and warnings.
- **Formatting:** Run `npm run format` to auto-format your code.
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Husky and lint-staged will auto-check your code before every commit.
- **Testing:** Make sure all tests pass with `npm test`.
- **Type Safety:** Use TypeScript best practices and avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary.
